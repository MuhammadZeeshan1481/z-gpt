# Production Hardening TODO

- [x] Install python dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov) in local environment and run `pytest`.
- [x] Address any test failures from the new backend test suite.
- [x] Expand README with lazy-load configuration notes (`CHAT_DEVICE`, `IMAGE_ENABLED`, etc.) and testing instructions.
- [x] Polish frontend UX (loading states, error banners for API failures, streaming UI).
- [x] Add deployment assets (Dockerfile, CI workflow, environment docs).
